PHP CLI interface to Jira via PHP SOAP client

* Setup

1. Copy config.sample.php to config.php and update settings
2. Run the scripts with the usage instructions printed at the top of each script.

* Outstanding tasks

** TODO Limit number of results for a filter
May require using Jira 4.0, as getIssuesFromFilterWithLimit seems to fail, even though it's part of the spec for Jira 3.13

** TODO Test with Jira 4.0 and JQL
